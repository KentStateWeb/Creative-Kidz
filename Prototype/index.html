          <li>Connor started Creative Kidz Learning Center on Monday…and so far,
            he couldn’t be happier (or healthier)!</br>—Karen</li>
          <li>Special Thanks to Jonathan and Frank Smith for helping to make my
            babies’ birthday party a blast! Would definitely recommend Creative
            Kidz Learning Center as a place to celebrate your child’s birthday!
            Lots of fun</br>—Abby</li>
          <li>We had our daughter in a private sitters care for a year.
            We had to make a change to a facility because our needs changed.
            Our little one loves it so much and the staff made the transition
            so easy for us. She has learned so much in the last year we
            couldn’t be happier. You know a good daycare when you walk in
            and hear children laughing and having a great time.</br>—Dan</li>
