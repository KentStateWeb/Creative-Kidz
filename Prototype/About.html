                   <h2>Creatively Designed for Creative Minds</h2>
                   <p>Our school is designed to create a safe and happy environment
                     for the growth and education of our children. Everything was put
                     together with children in mind. The whole facility is bright and
                     colorful with plenty of natural light. A beautiful creative mural
                     and the aquarium keeps children interested, excited and fascinated
                     in the reception area. All classes have windows looking in so parents
                     and staff can observe the children.</p>
                  <h2>Our Classrooms</h2>
                   <p>Classrooms are designed for all age groups and are color themed.
                     There’s always time for play. Our school has 2 playgrounds outdoors
                     for different age groups and one indoor play area. The equipment have
                     been chosen with safety in mind and they are age appropriate for all
                     the children. Rubber material is used so children can play and run safely.

                  <p>Hello! I'm Teacher Kathy, and I'm the Co-Teacher for the teaching center. I started
                    as a floater/substitute in February of 2012, and am very excited to now be able to
                    dedicate myself to the Jr. Toddler class full time! I have a Bachelors degree in Music
                    Education from University of Akron and continuing education in Early Childhood. I've
                    worked with kids of all ages since I was one myself. I love working with children
                    because they're so honest, fun-loving and do and say the most outrageous things! I
                    find myself laughing a lot when I'm with them. I love to see them learn and grow as
                    they discover and experience the world around them.</p>
